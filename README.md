# Data Analysis in Google Colab

## Project Description
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis using a mushroom dataset, with the goal of identifying different types of mushrooms and predicting their edibility based on their physical and chemical characteristics.

### Notebook Structure
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Various variables in the dataset are explored, including the distribution of edible and poisonous mushrooms, as well as their distinctive characteristics.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs are presented that illustrate the relationship between the characteristics of mushrooms (such as cap shape, color, habitat, and odor) and their edibility.
- **Conclusions**: Key insights are drawn regarding the identification of edible and poisonous mushrooms, and the relevance of each characteristic analyzed.

## Key Results
- The distribution of edible and poisonous mushrooms shows a clear difference in cap characteristics and odor.
- Mushrooms with caps of certain colors tend to be more edible, while other colors are more associated with danger.
- Habitats have a significant impact on the diversity of edible and poisonous mushrooms.
